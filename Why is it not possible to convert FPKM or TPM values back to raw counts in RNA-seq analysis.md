Converting **FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million)** or **TPM (Transcripts Per Million)** back to **raw counts** in RNA-seq is not possible due to information loss during the normalization process. Hereâ€™s why:

### **1. FPKM and TPM Normalize for Gene Length**
   - Raw counts represent the **actual number of reads** mapped to a gene.
   - FPKM and TPM divide these counts by **gene length** to adjust for differences in transcript sizes.
   - Since this operation involves division, **the original counts cannot be recovered unless you have access to gene lengths and the exact scaling factors** used.

### **2. TPM and FPKM Normalize for Sequencing Depth**
   - Raw counts depend on the total number of reads in a sample.
   - FPKM divides by the total mapped reads in millions.
   - TPM goes further by ensuring all TPM values sum to 1 million.
   - This means the original library size information is lost.

### **3. Loss of Integer Nature of Raw Counts**
   - Raw counts are whole numbers (integers).
   - FPKM and TPM introduce **fractions** due to normalization.
   - Even if you try to reverse the transformation, you wonâ€™t recover the exact original counts.

### **4. Different Scaling Factors Between Samples**
   - If two samples have different sequencing depths, the scaling factors will differ.
   - This makes it impossible to reverse-engineer the raw counts for a single sample unless you know the original sequencing depth.

### **Conclusion**
Once raw counts are transformed into **FPKM or TPM**, you lose critical information about:
1. **Library size (total read count per sample)**
2. **Gene length normalization factors**
3. **The original integer counts**

This makes a perfect conversion **mathematically impossible**. If you need raw counts, itâ€™s best to obtain them directly from quantification tools like **featureCounts** or **HTSeq-count** instead of using FPKM or TPM. ðŸš€
